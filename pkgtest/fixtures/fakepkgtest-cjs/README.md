# Super meta programmatic project that should use our tests

This is the skeleton of files that we dump into each pkgtest project so that we can then test calling pkgtest in an importing context.

We don't provide a package.json since pkgtest will make that for us (TODO - might be nice to use template-sync to merge things).
